  Overview
=============================================================================

This package accompanies the paper "The impact of RPython on VM design and
implementation" by Carl Friedrich Bolz and Laurence Tratt. It automates the
building and running of the experimental results therein, so that others can
reproduce the results and study them.

We have attempted to make this as automated as possible on Unix machines. We
recommend that the machine you run this on has at least 6Gb RAM (preferably
8Gb). You may need to install some background software, although the build
process does its best to detect this when started. The only piece of software
we can not easily automate the download of is Java: you will need to provide
your own Java VM (including javac) and put it into your $PATH.

From a new install of Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (you will need the 64bit version), you
can get all dependencies with:

  $ sudo apt-get update
  $ sudo apt-get install git make mercurial subversion unzip openjdk-7-jdk autoconf libpcre3-dev libexpat-dev libxml2-dev libbz2-dev ncurses-dev libffi-dev libc6-dev

Converge seems to look for specific static libraries, and I don't think you get
these by default with Ubuntu so you need to install them from sources:

  * libxml2 (configure --without-python)
  * libpcre

In general you can simply execute make:

  $ make

This will build the necessary software (which takes approximately 1-2 hours)
and then run the experiments. These default to 30 repetitions of each
benchmark, for a rough running time of 3-7 days. If you want a shorter run,
you can edit the REPS parameter at the top of run_benchmarks.sh (minimum
value is 1). When complete, you will see the raw output from multitime in the
"results" file; if you have Python installed, a pretty-printed HTML version
of the results can be found in results.html.


=============================================================================
  LoC
=============================================================================

We have also automated the Lines of Code (LoC) count for VMs so that you can
see precisely what we have included and excluded. In general you can simply
execute:

  $ ./loc.sh

If "build.sh" has not previously been run, "build.sh" will automatically be
executed to download all the VMs.
